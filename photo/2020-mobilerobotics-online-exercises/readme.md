These are the exercises that we arranged for the online course
"Mobile Robotics". The individual exercises stem from related
courses taught at the University of Bonn. Thus, the numbering
of the exercises within the notebook files are not consistent;
but in this way, files are identical for identical exercises.

The intention of sharing the exercises is to allow students to 
study and practice on their own and get a deeper understanding 
of the topic. 

For the exercises, you need to use Python and Jupyter notebooks.
Please note that we cannot provide any support for the exercises.
